                <div class="subtitle-block">#Conclusion</div><br>
                    <p>In conclusion, based on our numerical, textual, and visual analyses, we deduce that Glossier's success stems from its tactic of proactive, customer-centric interaction via Twitter and inclusive, visual-based marketing on multiple social media accounts. Its success-inducing characteristics are the unique yet accessible culture it promotes, its emphasis on simple aesthetics, and focus on customer-centric products. We also conclude that followers are attracted to Glossier mainly because of the products offered, which is followed and buttressed by the lifestyle and inclusive concept it espouses.
                    </p><p>
The story our analyses reveals is that of a young brand that is getting trendier and amassing a larger fanbase by the day. Our recommendations for other beauty retailers, e-commerce companies, or any organizations aiming to flourish via social media is to focus on visually-stimulating and stylish advertising and to leverage various accounts to interact positively and mutually-beneficially with followers - that is, not only to proactively address concerns, but to listen to suggestions and implement changes and products that align with customer needs. </p><hr>
